Players control a fish that pops alphabet bubbles to spell out Malay words. This is a fun and interactive way to engage MSP students, improve their Malay vocabulary, and promote greater interest in the Malay language. The mBoggle competition attracts about 200 MSP students from different schools in Singapore. From 2019 onwards, Ikan oh Ikan will be the game used in the competition. <e>*** the link works only on the school network</e>",
